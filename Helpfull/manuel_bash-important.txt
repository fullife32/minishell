DEFINITION
* --------------------------	*

builtin
A command that is implemented internally by the shell itself, 
rather than by an executable program somewhere in the file system.

control operator
A token that performs a control function. 
It is a newline or one of the following:
 ‘||’, ‘&&’, ‘&’, ‘;’, ‘;;’, ‘;&’, ‘;;&’, ‘|’, ‘|&’, ‘(’, or ‘)’.

 metacharacter
A character that, when unquoted, separates words. A metacharacter 
is a space, tab, newline, or one of the following characters: 
‘|’, ‘&’, ‘;’, ‘(’, ‘)’, ‘<’, or ‘>’.

operator
A control operator or a redirection operator. 
See Redirections, for a list of redirection operators. 
Operators contain at least one unquoted metacharacter.

process group
A collection of related processes each having the same process group ID.

reserved word
A word that has a special meaning to the shell. 
Most reserved words introduce shell flow control constructs, such as for and while.

signal
A mechanism by which a process may be notified by the kernel of an event occurring in the system.




Shell Operation
* --------------------------	*
The following is a brief description of the shell’s operation when it reads and executes a command.
Basically, the shell does the following:

1	Reads its input from a file (see Shell Scripts), from a string supplied as an argument to the -c 
	invocation option (see Invoking Bash), or from the user’s terminal.

2	Breaks the input into words and operators, obeying the quoting rules described in Quoting. 
	These tokens are separated by metacharacters. Alias expansion is performed by this step (see Aliases).

3	Parses the tokens into simple and compound commands (see Shell Commands).

4	Performs the various shell expansions (see Shell Expansions), breaking the expanded tokens into lists 
	of filenames (see Filename Expansion) and commands and arguments.

5	Performs any necessary redirections (see Redirections) and removes the redirection operators 
	and their operands from the argument list.

6	Executes the command (see Executing Commands).

7	Optionally waits for the command to complete and collects its exit status (see Exit Status).
